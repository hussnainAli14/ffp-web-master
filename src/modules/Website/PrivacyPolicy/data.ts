If you are a resident of the United States, please consult the section titled “United States residents’ rights” to understand the rights that apply to you. Additionally, you can review our supplementary CCPA notice for more information.

If you are one of our supply partners, please refer to our Supplier Privacy Policy to understand how personal data is processed within the scope of our business relationship.

1. Controller and contact

The Controller responsible for processing your personal data is:

Controller: FFPTravels Pty

Address: Cairns, Australia

Contact: https://www.ffptravels.com/contact/

For clarity, any data processing by Activity Providers who offer their services on the FFPTravels Platform is subject to their respective privacy policies. Activity providers act as separate data controllers.

2. Automated data collection

When you visit our websites or mobile apps, we automatically collect certain information. The following data is stored separately from other data that you may transmit to us:

- URL of the page accessed
- Latency of the network connection
- Date and time
- Information about your computer’s hardware and software (such as the operating system, the internet browser used, software/application version data and your language settings).
- Information about clicks and which pages have been shown to you.

We store this data for the following purposes:

- For load balancing, i.e., to distribute access to our website across several devices and to be able to offer you the fastest possible loading times;
- To ensure the security of our IT systems, e.g., to defend against specific attacks on our systems and to recognize attack patterns;
- To ensure the proper operation of our IT systems, e.g., if errors occur that we can only rectify by storing the IP address;
- To enable criminal prosecution, averting of danger or legal prosecution in the event of specific indications of criminal offenses.

Your IP address is encrypted to ensure confidentiality and is only accessible when absolutely necessary. It is retained for a period of 45 days.

If you’re using a mobile device, we collect data that identifies the device, as well as data about your device-specific settings and characteristics, app crashes, and other system activity.

In this case, the processing is carried out to ensure the security of the processing in accordance with Art. 32 GDPR, as well as on the basis of our legitimate interest in protecting ourselves against misuse of our service (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).

3. FFPTravels account

If you create a FFPTravels user account, you may provide us with the following data:

- Surname/first name

Alternatively, you can log in with your Facebook, Google, or Apple account. In this case, we receive the following personal data from Facebook or Google or Apple in order to create a user account for you:

- Name

- An authentication token

Your registration data is required to set up and manage a user account for you. In this case, you conclude a (free) user agreement with us, on the basis of which we collect this data (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR).

In order to conclude the agreement, you must provide us with this data. However, you are neither contractually nor legally obliged to conclude the agreement and thus to provide the data.

3.2 Wishlists

After you have created a user account, you have the option to create wishlists with activities and tours and to share these wishlists with other users. Your data is processed for these purposes in order to be able to provide you with the corresponding functions (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR).

4. Reviews and ratings

Our website offers the possibility to rate and comment on tours or activities. After you have completed a tour booked via our website, we may ask you to rate it accordingly. Submitting a rating is, of course, voluntary. You have the option to submit the review anonymously. When you submit a rating, we collect the data you enter in order to process it according to the function you use and publish it on our website. You can have a rating deleted at any time by contacting our customer service.

You can object at any time to receiving review requests by clicking the unsubscribe link in each review request email. If you have an account, you can also do so from the Settings -> Notifications section on your profile. Otherwise, you can also send us a message using the link https://www.ffptravels.com/contact/.

The processing of your data for these purposes is done to protect our legitimate interest in providing our users with as much information as possible about the tours we offer. User ratings are also in the interest of all users (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).

5. Customer support

5.1 Processing of enquiries

If you get in touch with our customer service team or reach out to us through other means such as our social media channels, your request will be processed by our processor, FFPTravels Global Services GmbH.

For handling such enquiries, we, or FFPTravels Global Services GmbH use systems provided by Zendesk, Inc. based in the USA. Zendesk is certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, both of which are administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce. This ensures that data transferred is handled with a level of protection compliant with EU data protection requirements. Additionally, we, or FFPTravels Global Services GmbH utilize the services of Chatbotize sp. z o.o., based in Poland, to offer an automated chatbot that assists in managing and responding to customer queries.

For the processing and administration of enquiries via our social media channels, we or FFPTravels Global Services GmbH also use the services of NICE Ltd, based in the UK.

5.2 Improvement of customer service

In order to continuously improve our customer service, we analyze enquiries sent to us on the basis of certain parameters and keywords. Although, as a matter of principle, no analysis is carried out on the basis of personal data, it cannot be ruled out that, in individual cases, personal data may also be processed within this context. The processing required within this context serves our legitimate interest as well as that of our customers in the continuous improvement of our customer service (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).

For the evaluation of enquiries, we use the systems of the providers Chattermill Analytics Limited (Great Britain) and the business intelligence platform Looker, provided by Google, Ltd. (Ireland).

5.3 Translations

In certain cases, it is necessary for us to translate incoming requests into a specific language. This may require the processing of personal data necessary to protect our legitimate interest in providing international customer service, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. For this purpose, we use the services of DeepL SE and OpenAI, Inc. There is no EU Commission adequacy decision for the USA. We have therefore concluded the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission with Unbabel in accordance with Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR.

5.4 Storage and evaluation of telephone calls

Telephone calls are only stored and analyzed if you have given us your prior consent. We will only use this data for the purpose of improving our customer service. The recordings will be deleted after three months. The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. You have the option to revoke your consent at any time by contacting one of the contact channels mentioned in this privacy policy. This will not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out by us until your revocation.

6. Technical service providers

We use technical service providers for hosting and some of the services required for the website. Accordingly, the processing of data takes place on the servers of these service providers. These service providers only process the data according to our explicit instructions and are obliged to guarantee sufficient technical and organizational measures for data protection. Consequently, our service providers act for us as so-called processors within the meaning of Art. 28 GDPR.

6.1 Hosting of the website

For the hosting of our website, we use the services of Amazon Web Services EMEA S.a.r.l. ("AWS") based in Luxembourg. Accordingly, when you interact with our website or provide personal data, it is processed on AWS servers. We only use servers located in the European Union. To cover remote maintenance and similar constellations, we have concluded the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission with AWS in accordance with Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR.

6.2 E-Mails

For sending emails, we use the Sendgrid service of Twilio Inc based in the USA ("Twilio"). Twilio is certified to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework with the U.S. Department of Commerce.

7. Newsletter

You have the option on our website to register for our newsletter. With our newsletter, we would like to send you information on offers, tours, activities, or special promotions that are as personalized as possible. By registering for our newsletter, you therefore consent to us processing your email address for the purpose of sending the newsletter. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit a GDPR. You can revoke your consent at any time by unsubscribing from our newsletter. To do this, you can use the unsubscribe link contained in every email or send us a message using the link https://www.ffptravels.com/contact/. To verify your email address, you will first receive a registration email, which you must confirm via a link (double opt-in). When you register for the newsletter, we store the IP address and the date and time of registration. The processing of this data is necessary to be able to prove that consent has been given. The legal basis results from our legal obligation to prove your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c in conjunction with Art. 7 para. 1 GDPR).

If you have booked a tour via our website or created a FFPTravels account, we will send you our newsletter based on our legitimate interest in promoting similar services to your bookings or account (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, § 7 para. 3 UWG) unless you have objected to this use. If cookies are used for newsletter personalization, we will obtain your separate consent.

You can object to this at any time – even during registration – by deselecting the corresponding checkbox or clicking the unsubscribe link in the respective emails. In addition, if you have an account, you can always subscribe or unsubscribe to different types of communication from the Settings -> Notifications section on your profile.

For the dispatch of our newsletter and the personalization of content, we use the services of the provider Braze Inc. based in the USA ("Braze"). Braze is certified to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework with the U.S. Department of Commerce.

8. Bookings & payments

8.1 Bookings

When you book a tour, activity, or similar on our site, we collect the data required to carry out the tour. This usually includes the following information: First and last name, billing address, email address, telephone number, number of participants, date, and time. Depending on the activity booked, it may also be necessary for us to collect further information, such as your flight number or the age of the participants. The processing that takes place in connection with this is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. To the extent necessary, we will transfer your data to the provider responsible for the tour or activity who will process your personal data as set out in their privacy policy as an independent data controller. If a transfer to a third country outside the European Economic Area is necessary, this is based on Art. 49 para. 2 lit. b, c GDPR.

If you make bookings via partner sites, you will be redirected to provide your personal data and conclude the booking process on the FFPTravels website, as described above. On some partner sites, your data is collected by the partner as a separate data controller, in accordance with their privacy policy, and we receive the data required to make the booking from the partner.

On other websites that have partnered with us in order to integrate the booking offers directly on their own website, both the partner and FFPTravels act as separate data controllers for the processing of your personal data.

You have the option to share the booking details with other participants by providing the email address where FFPTravels can send them the booking confirmation and important communication related to the booking. If you choose to do so, it is your responsibility to get consent from the participant to share their email address with FFPTravels.

8.2 Booking confirmations

In order to keep you updated on your bookings we will send you booking confirmations as well as reminders and updates for upcoming bookings (e.g., changed times or meeting points) to make sure that you have all information you need to attend your booked services. Booking confirmations are sent to your email address, and/or by SMS to the phone number you provide during the booking process and/or through a push notification from the FFPTravels app. If you have an account, you can choose more granularly how you want to be notified from the Settings -> Notifications section on your profile.

We process your personal data in order to be able to provide you with these features of our service (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR).

8.3 Payments

You have various options for paying for your booking. In doing so, we will process the data required in each case depending on the selected payment method. Within this context, your personal data will be processed as described below, which is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR and is necessary to carry out the payment method you have chosen.

8.3.1 Credit card payments

For the processing of payments by credit card, we use the service provider Adyen N.V. ("Adyen"), which is based in the Netherlands. The data provided during your payment will be forwarded by Adyen to the respective banks or financial institutions for the purpose of processing the payment. In the case of payments by credit card, we only receive the information that a payment has or has not been made, along with the first and the last 4 digits of the credit card number. We therefore have no knowledge of your full credit card number.

For the processing of payments by credit card, we also use the services of Primer API Limited, based in the UK, as a payment orchestration service that automatically redirects the payment request to the appropriate payment service provider.

8.3.2 Payment via PayPal

If you have a PayPal account, you can also process your payment via PayPal. In this case, we receive from PayPal not only the information that a payment has been made, but also the email address and address you have registered with PayPal.

8.3.3 Payment by invoice

If you pay by invoice, we will transfer your personal data to Klarna Bank AB (publ) based in Sweden ("Klarna"). Klarna will process the data first for the purpose of credit assessment and then, if necessary, for payment processing.

8.4 Chargebacks

In the event of chargebacks, we use the services of Global Merchant Risk Technologies trading as The Chargeback Company (Chargebacks911) based in Ireland to process a chargeback on behalf of FFPTravels. For this purpose, we give Chargebacks911 access to your booking data, including the limited payment information stored (the first and last 4 digits of your credit card). Chargebacks911 will then process the chargeback with your bank or PayPal or Adyen. The processing is carried out within the context of the execution of the contract (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR) as well as on the basis of our legitimate interest in the effective processing of chargebacks (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).

8.5 Booking Cancellation Insurance

If you visit our website from certain regions, you will be able to also book activities with extended cancellation rights covered by insurance. The insurance coverage is offered to you by Companjon Admin GmbH with a registered address at c/o Wilhelm Rechtsanwälte Partnerschaft von Rechtsanwälten mbB, Reichsstraße 43, 40217 Düsseldorf. If you book this option, your personal data will be processed based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.

With regards to the data processing connected to offering these insurances on the FFPTravels website, FFPTravels and Companjon Admin GmbH act as joint data controllers. With regards to the data processing directly connected to the insurance contract (such as eligibility, decision-making process, claim processing, etc.), Companjon Admin GmbH acts as an independent data controller.

You can exercise your data subject rights towards either FFPTravels or Companjon and we will ensure the request is forwarded to the responsible party.

9. Fraud prevention

In order to protect ourselves and the activity providers from fraudulent bookings, we evaluate the information provided by our customers during the booking process, including the data technically transmitted by their device, insofar as this is necessary to protect our legitimate interest and that of the activity providers in reliable bookings

 (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).

For this purpose, we use services of the providers Sift Science, Inc. (USA), Adyen N.V. (Netherlands) and Ethoca Inc. (Canada). We have therefore concluded the standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission with Sift Science, Inc. pursuant to Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR. For Canada, there is an adequacy decision by the EU Commission in accordance with Art. 45 GDPR for processing by private-sector organizations.

10. Protection against bots

To protect us from bots and similar technologies, we use the Cheq service provided by CHEQ AI Technologies Ltd. based in Israel ("Cheq"). Cheq will use the data automatically transmitted by your device to determine whether the request most likely originates from a human. No further storage of the data will take place. The processing is carried out in order to ensure the security of the processing in accordance with Art. 32 GDPR and on the basis of our legitimate interest in protecting ourselves against misuse of our service (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). For Israel, there is an adequacy decision of the EU Commission according to Art. 45 GDPR.

11. Cookies and other online tracking technologies

We use so-called "cookies" and other online tracking technologies to offer certain functions of our website, to optimise the use of our website and our apps, or for the purpose of executing our marketing and advertising strategy.

Specifically, we use (unless other cookies are specified elsewhere in this privacy policy or our cookie consent) the following cookies and tracking technologies:

- Session cookies: These cookies are needed to store certain technical data during your visit to our website, e.g., to determine whether you have logged in.
- Persistent cookies: These cookies are needed to store data beyond a browser session if you wish to do so.
- **Web beacons (such as tags or tracking pixels)**: They can be used to retrieve information from your device, such as your device type or operating system, your IP address, and the time of your visit. They are also used to serve and read cookies in your browser or to trigger the placement of a cookie.
- **Scripts**: Are small computer programs embedded within our web pages that support different functionality (security features, interactive features, etc.). They can also be used for analytical or advertising purposes. For example, a script can collect information about how you use our website, such as which pages you visit or what you search for.
- **Tracking URLs**: These are links with a unique identifier in them used to track which website brought you to our website or the app.
- **Software Development Kits (SDKs)**: Are part of our app source code and unlike browser cookies, SDK data is stored in the app storage. They’re used to analyse how the apps are being used, send personalised push notifications, or to allow the app to share data with third parties. To do this, they record unique identifiers associated with your device, like device ID and IP address, as well as your in-app activity and your network location.

We categorise cookies and other tracking technologies into the following categories:

- **Strictly Necessary Technologies**: These are technologies required for our websites and apps to function and they must be enabled in order for you to use our services.
- **Analytical Technologies**: These measure and track how our website and apps are used. We use this information to improve our website, apps, and services.
- **Marketing Technologies**: These are used by FFPTravels and other trusted partners to collect information about user journeys both on the website and in the app, in order to deliver relevant sponsored content about our products and to execute our marketing and advertising strategy.

You can find more detailed information about each category and give or withdraw consent from Analytical or Marketing Technologies by accessing the link “Cookies and Marketing Preferences” in our website footer or from the “Privacy Preferences” section in the App menu.

The tool enables you to activate or deactivate cookies, trackers, SDKs, and other technologies used on our website and in the FFPTravels apps. You can navigate between the different groups of technologies and find detailed information about each group, as well as more information about the third parties FFPTravels might share your data with. You have the option to turn each of the categories on or off individually.

Your preferences will be remembered across devices and platforms (Website and Apps): for example, when you accept or reject all non-essential tracking technologies by using this tool while navigating the website, your choice will be remembered with the help of a unique identifier and non-essential tracking technologies will be automatically enabled or disabled when you access the FFPTravels App. The legal basis for the use of these cookies is § 25 para. 2 of the German Telecommunications and Telemedia Data Protection Act (TTDSG) or Art. 6 para. 1 b GDPR, insofar as they are necessary for the use of our website and the functions you have accessed. Otherwise, we use cookies and other tracking technologies – as described below – on the basis of your consent. You can revoke your consent at any time via our consent manager.

12. Customer Research and Visitor Journey Recordings

12.1 Customer surveys and research panels

We or research agencies we collaborate with might invite you to participate in moderated or unmoderated research panels. You might be either an FFPTravels customer or an external participant recruited independently by the agency. The participation and the video recordings of these sessions are always based on your express consent, which we collect in writing before the research activity. Research agencies we might collaborate with are: Respondent, Inc., a company based in the US (you can find their Privacy Policy here), Userlytics, a company based in the US (you can find their Privacy Policy here), Lookback Group Inc., a company located in the US (you can find their Privacy Policy here).

When you access our website, you might be prompted in a pop-up window to answer some questions about the FFPTravels product or features. We collect the answers in an aggregate form and they are not linked personally to you. This is completely optional and you give your consent for us to process your answers if you choose to answer the questions.

12.2 Visitor Journey Recordings

We use heat mapping services of Hotjar Ltd., Dragonara Business Centre, 5th Floor, Dragonara Road, Paceville St Julian's STJ 3141, Malta. Heat mapping services are used to display and record the areas of a page where visitors most frequently move the mouse or click. This shows us where the points of interest are, for the purpose of improving our website and our services. The recording happens only on certain pages and for a daily limited number of random visitor sessions. The recording is kept for a period of 365 days and then automatically deleted. We process this data on the basis of consent. Hotjar honors generic “Do Not Track” requests; if you want to exercise this right, you can access Hotjar’s opt-out information here.

If you have consented, we use Google Analytics 360, a web analytics service. Google Analytics 360 collects pseudonymous data from you about the use of our website, including your shortened IP address, and uses cookies. This data is transmitted to a Google server in the US and stored there. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website and the app, compiling reports on website and app activity, and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.

If you have consented, we use advertising products from Google. We use cookies, client tags, server-to-server, SDKs, to record and share your usage behaviour on our website and in the app in order to display interest-based advertising for our products on other pages within the Google advertising network. This includes Google Search, YouTube, and other sites operated by Google and its subsidiaries, as well as sites operated by Google's advertising partners. The information, such as hashed identifiers and browsing activity, is transmitted accordingly to Google and Google's partners. Additional data processing will only take place if you have consented to Google linking your browsing history to your Google Account and using information from your Google Account to personalise the ads you see on the web. In this case, Google will use your data together with Google Analytics data to create and define target group lists for remarketing. To do this, your personal data will be temporarily linked by Google with Google Analytics data to form target groups.

The use of these services is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR).

You can revoke your consent via our consent manager. This does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out until your revocation. Furthermore, the remarketing cookie is automatically deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we collected or used it in accordance with the above paragraphs.

13.3 Meta services (Facebook, Instagram)

We use the services of Meta Platforms Ireland Limited ("Meta") described below. Please note that this may also involve processing by Meta Inc. based in the USA. Meta Platforms, Inc.

13.3.1. Meta Pixel and Server to Server

We share data about some of your FFPTravels interactions with Meta to show you more relevant ads or to help find similar audiences. Your shared data also helps us monitor and analyze our marketing success to optimize ad efficiency. FFPTravels and Meta are Joint Controllers for this technology, governed by a Controller Addendum.

If you have consented, the Meta pixel and server-to-server connection is used on our website and the app to transmit data to Meta. We record when you perform certain actions on our website and apps, as well as usage data (such as URL, referrer URL, IP address, device and browser characteristics and timestamp) and transmit it to Meta associated with hashed identifiers. If available, your Facebook ID is transmitted. Meta will use this information to understand which ad you clicked, to measure the success of certain ads and to provide us with this information in aggregate form. If you have a Facebook profile and log in there, you can be presented with targeted personalised advertising on Facebook based on the data transmitted. Data from users who do not have a Facebook or Instagram profile is discarded by Meta without being used.

We use the Meta pixel on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke your consent at any time via our consent manager. This does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out until your revocation.

China is a country that - in the terms of EU Regulation 2016/679 - does not provide an adequate level of protection of personal data, and TikTok relies on Standard Contractual Clauses for this international data transfer. Here you can read more about TikTok’s global data transfer details.

18. Further sharing of data

Beyond the cases described, your personal data will only be passed on without your express prior consent in the following cases:

If it is necessary for the clarification of an illegal use of our services or for legal prosecution, personal data will be forwarded to the law enforcement authorities and, if necessary, to injured third parties. However, this only happens if there are specific indications of unlawful or abusive behaviour. A transfer may also take place if this serves to enforce terms of use or other agreements. We are also legally obliged to provide information to certain public authorities upon request. These are law enforcement agencies, authorities that prosecute administrative offences subject to fines and the tax authorities.

This data is disclosed on the basis of our legitimate interest in combating abuse, prosecuting criminal offences and securing, asserting and enforcing claims and provided that your rights and interests in the protection of your personal data are not overridden, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR or on the basis of a legal obligation pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR.

We disclose personal data to auditors, accounting service providers, lawyers, banks, tax consultants and similar bodies insofar as this is necessary for the provision of our services (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR) or the proper operation of our business (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) or we are obliged to do so (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR).

We rely on contractually affiliated third-party companies and external service providers ("processors") to provide the services. In such cases, personal data is passed on to these processors to enable them to continue processing. These processors are carefully selected and regularly reviewed by us to ensure that your rights and freedoms are protected. The processors may only use the data for the purposes specified by us and are also contractually obliged by us to treat your data exclusively in accordance with this privacy policy and the German data protection laws.

The transfer of data to processors takes place on the basis of Art. 28 para. 1 GDPR.

As part of the further development of our business, it may happen that the structure of FFPTravels Deutschland GmbH changes by changing the legal form, founding, buying or selling subsidiaries, parts of the company or components. In such transactions, customer information is passed on together with the part of the company to be transferred. Whenever personal information is disclosed to third parties to the extent described above, we will ensure that this is done in accordance with this privacy policy and the relevant data protection laws.

Any disclosure of personal data is justified by the fact that we have a legitimate interest in adapting our corporate form to the economic and legal circumstances as necessary (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).

19. Automated individual decisions or profiling measures

We do not use any automated processing processes to bring about a decision or profiling.

20. Erasure of your data

We delete or anonymise your personal data as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we collected or used it in accordance with the above paragraphs. We also continue to retain your data if we are obliged to do so for legal reasons or if the data is needed for a longer period of time for criminal prosecution or to secure, assert or enforce legal claims.

If you delete your user account, your profile will be deleted completely and permanently. However, we will retain backup copies of your data to the extent and for as long as this data is required for legal reasons or for criminal prosecution or to secure, assert or enforce legal claims.

If data must be retained for legal reasons, processing will be restricted. The data is then no longer available for further use.

Storage beyond the contractual relationship is based on our aforementioned legitimate interests according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.22. United States residents’ rights
